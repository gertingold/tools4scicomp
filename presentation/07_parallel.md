* parallel time: $T_\text{p} = \dfrac{fT_1}{p}$

* speedup: $S_\text{p} = \dfrac{T_1}{T_\text{s}+T_\text{p}} = \dfrac{1}{1-f+\dfrac{f}{p}}$

  Amdahl's law represents a theoretical optimum which is not reached because of 
  overhead for parallel computation.

# Communication overhead

* suppose that the whole program can be executed in parallel in the time: $T_\text{p}=\dfrac{T_1}{p}$
* time spent for communication between different processes: $T_\text{c}$

<br />

* speedup $S_\text{p} = \dfrac{T_1}{\dfrac{T_1}{p}+T_\text{c}} < p$

<br />

* In the limit $p\to\infty$, the time is dominated by the communication time $T_\text{c}$.
* For the communication time to be irrelevant, we need
  $$p\ll\dfrac{T_1}{T_\text{c}}\,.$$

<br />

* More cores lead to more need for communication.

---

# Race condition

<img src="/images/race.png" style="width: 100%; margin: auto">

<br />

* If processes are not properly synchronized and use shared memory, results may be incorrect.
* One process might have to wait for another one to complete its computation.
* One process needs to signal to the other one that it has completed its computation.
* Waiting times reduce the speed-up.

---

# Threads

* Threads share a common range of memory.
* Therefore, they can access the same data and easily exchange data with other threads.
* Threads result in little overhead.
* However, if data are not accessed and modified in the right order, mistakes may occur.
* Such mistakes can be very difficult to identify, because there occurrence may depend 
  on the details of the timing.

<br />

* For CPython, the global interpreter lock (GIL) presently does not allow to execute 
  several threads in parallel.
* Multithreading in Python therefore is only useful for *I/O-bound* problems.
* For *runtime-bound* problems, multiple threads will lead to a performance reduction
  because of the overhead involved in switching between threads.

---

# Global interpreter lock (GIL)

* Memory management in CPython is done by reference counting.

``` python
>>> import sys
>>> a = [1, 2]
>>> sys.getrefcount(a)
2
>>> b = a
>>> sys.getrefcount(a)
3
>>> b = []
>>> sys.getrefcount(a)
2
```

* When the number of references to an object becomes zero, the memory occupied by
  that object will be released.
* Threads running in parallel can lead to an incorrect reference count causing
  either memory leakage or freeing memory which is still needed. This is prevented
  by the GIL.
* Side note: Because of the possibility of reference cycles, additional garbage
  collection is done.

---

# Processes

* The `multiprocessing` module allows to start several Python interpreters which
  can run independently, each with its own GIL.
* The interpreter processes can run on different cores and thus lead to a speed-up
  of runtime-bound tasks.
* However, starting new processes implies more overhead than starting new threads.
* Furthermore, data are not shared so that communication between processes is more
  complicated.

<br />

### Embarrassingly parallel problems

* A task can sometimes be decomposed into subtasks which do not need to communicate with each other.
* Example: Monte Carlo simulations with different seeds or runs for different parameters like temperature.
* For embarrassingly parallel problems, the `multiprocessing` module helps to easily organize
  the distribution of the problem over several processes and to collect the results.

---

# [PEP 703](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)

* PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal
* PEP 703: Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython
* proposal for implementation of a thread-safe memory management

<br />

* plans to abandon the GIL in steps over the next five years
* The process will be monitored and adjusted when necessary.
* For the moment, the CPython with GIL will remain the standard,
  but the possibility for a no-GIL build might appear in Python 3.13
  or Python 3.14.

# Example: Mandelbrot set

</div><div>

* For a complex number $c$, the recursion

  $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2+c$$

  is carried out with initial value $z_0=0$
* If the threshold $|z|=2$ is reached, it is known that the series will not be bounded.
* For a graphical representation, the number of iterations needed to reach this threshold
  is determined and colour-coded.
* The problem is embarrassingly parallel because the iteration can be done for each
  value of $c$ separately.

# The `concurrent` module

* With the help of the `concurrent.futures` module, parallel execution of code
  in threads or processes can be organized.
* We will consider the evaluation of a Mandelbrot set as example of an embarrassingly
  parallel problem which will be handled in parallel processes.

<br />

* import the module

```python
from concurrent import futures
```

* create a parameter list from which parameter sets will be taken and distributed
  to the different processes or workers
* use a `with` context to distribute the tasks and collect the results

```python
with futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executors:
    ...
```

* create a list scheduling function calls and collect the results in a list

---

# Parallel evaluation of Mandelbrot set

* Split region in the complex plane into subregions which will be handled
  by processes running in parallel.
* `import` statements

```python
from concurrent import futures
from itertools import product
from functools import partial
import numpy as np
```

* evaluation of the Mandelbrot set in a subregion
```python
def mandelbrot_tile(nitermax, nx, ny, cx, cy):
    x = np.zeros_like(cx)
    y = np.zeros_like(cx)
    data = np.zeros(cx.shape, dtype=int)
    for n in range(nitermax):
        x2 = x*x
        y2 = y*y
        notdone = x2+y2 < 4
        data[notdone] = n
        x[notdone], y[notdone] = (x2[notdone]-y2[notdone]+cx[notdone],
                                  2*x[notdone]*y[notdone]+cy[notdone])

# Compilation

* Before using more hardware ressources, other ways to speed-up execution should
  be explored.

<br />

* Python is an interpreted language
* compilation can yield significant speed-up by providing optimized machine code
  * [Cython](https://cython.org): script is converted to C as much as possible in order to be compiled
  * [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org): just-in-time (JIT) compilation, the code of a function is compiled
    when needed
    * There is an overhead during the first function call, but the machine code
      can be used in ensuing calls of that function.
    * Numba can also deal with NumPy arrays and can create universal functions
    * code can be vectorized for distribution on several cores

<br />

* We will discuss Numba as it can be used more easily.

---

# Example: evaluation of the Riemann zeta function

* Riemann zeta function will be evaluated in a very naive way by cutting the summation
  $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}$$
* There are ways to approximate the contribution of the neglected terms.
* There exist also other ways to the determine the Riemann zeta function, see 
  [here in section *Miscellaneous*](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/constants.html)

```python
def zeta(x, nmax):
    zetasum = 0
    for n in range(1, nmax+1):
        zetasum = zetasum+1/(n**x)
    return zetasum

print(zeta(2, 100000000))
```

* The relative error is 5.5Â·10â»â¹ with respect to the exact result $\pi^2/6$.
* The run-time on an i7-6700HQ processor is 8.7s.

# Numba version

* It was sufficient to add a decorator `numba.njit` to the function.
* In `njit` the part `jit` refers to the just-in-time compiler and
  `n` refers to the `nopython` mode.
* It can happen that Numba is not able to compile the entire function.
  Then, the decorator `numba.jit` with option `nopython=False` can be
  used and Numba will try to find loops which it can compile. The rest
  will be implying the Python interpreter and thus reduce performance.

```

```
[]

```

* As long as the function `zeta` was not called, no compilation happens.
* We have called the function `zeta` with two integer arguments. The
  function has been compiled for the corresponding signature.
* The data type is `int64` and therefore potentially subject to overflow
  in contrast to Python integers.

# Implementation (part 1)

<div class="grid grid-cols-[50%_1fr] gap-4"><div>

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy as np
from numpy import r_
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def jacobi_step(u):
    u_old = u.copy()
    u[1:-1, 1:-1] = 0.25*(u[0:-2, 1:-1] + u[2:, 1:-1]
                          + u[1:-1,0:-2] + u[1:-1, 2:])
    v = (u-u_old).flat
    return u, np.dot(v,v)

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()
root = 0

num_points = 500
rows_per_process = num_points//size
max_iter = 5000
num_iter = 0
total_err = 1
```

</div><div>

* The function `jacobi_step` averages over the nearest neighbors to update a lattice site.
* The comparison of the old and new values yields an error estimate. Alternatively, one
  could check how well the Laplace equation is satisfied.
* `num_points` defines the grid size.
* `rows_per_process` defines the number of matrix rows attributed to each process.

</div></div>

# Implementation (part 2)

<div class="grid grid-cols-[55%_1fr] gap-4"><div>

```python
m = None

if rank == root:
    m = np.zeros((num_points, num_points), dtype=float)
    m[0, :] = 1
    m[:, 0] = 1
    m[-1, :] = -1
    m[:, -1] = -1

my_grid = np.empty((rows_per_process, num_points), dtype=float)
comm.Scatterv(m, my_grid, root)
```

* The initial matrix `m` is defined for process 0, where an arrow containing zeros
  is filled with the boundary values.
* The top and the left boundary values are set to 1 while the bottom and the right
  boundary values are set to -1.

</div><div>

* In order to avoid an undefined variable for all other processes, `m` needs to be
  initialized. It is sufficent to set it to `None`.
* `Scatterv` distributes the section of the matrix `M` to the arrays `my_grid` of 
  the different processes.
* `my_grid` needs to exist and be sufficiently large. Therefore, we create an empty
  matrix of the required size.
* MPI methods starting with uppercase letters do not act on Python objects but on
  buffers instead.

  to broadcast this information to all processes. Otherwise process 0
  might terminate due to the `while` condition while the other processes
  remain in the loop waiting for data from process 0. The program will
  then hang.
